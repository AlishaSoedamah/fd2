			<h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
			<p>We started in 2021 with our Instagram account where we offered our carefully curated vintage items. After a year of slowly growing our 'Instagram Store' on the side, we decided to take the next step and set up a website with webshop. As of from December 2021 we're live!</p>
			<p>You can purchase all items we offer online straight in our webshop from now on and don't have to DM us first through Instagram. Easier and quicker for all of us! This doesn't mean that we won't be as active as before on our Instagram account of course! We'll still be sharing our items on Instagram and will still always be there when you have any questions, so keep the DM's coming! :)</p>

			<h3>ITEMS</h3>
			<p>The items that you purchase with us — if not stated differently — are vintage and manufactured in the past. These items are pre-owned and show signs of use. So please be aware of this and you will have to be okay with this before purchasing with us of course! We always try to describe the condition of our items the best we can and take many pictures so you can see the state it's in.</p>
